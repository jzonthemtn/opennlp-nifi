# Apache OpenNLP Processors for Apache NiFi

This repository contains [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org) processors that use [Apache OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org) for NLP model training, evaluation, and deployment.

With these processors you can retrieve NLP model training data, convert it to the OpenNLP training format, train a model, evaluate the model, and optionally deploy a model should the trained model meet the thresholds necessary for deployment.
